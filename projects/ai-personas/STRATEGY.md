2. Develop the AI persona with a hyper-realistic appearance, capable of performing basic actions like walking, drinking coffee, posing, etc.
3. Create TikTok and Instagram accounts for the persona.
4. Post new content to the accounts on a daily basis (1 post per day).
5. Develop a strategic plan for growing the persona's following and eventual monetization.

## Execution Plan
