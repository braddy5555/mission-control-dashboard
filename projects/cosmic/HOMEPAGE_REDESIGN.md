# Cosmic Puppies Website Redesign

## Homepage Layout

The homepage will feature a split-screen design with two large, prominent buttons:

**Left Side:**
- Button Text: "AI"
- Button CTA: "Discover Our AI Automation Services"
- On click, loads the AI-focused content and services

**Right Side:**
- Button Text: "Web3" 
- Button CTA: "Explore Our Web3 Ecosystem Solutions"
- On click, loads the Web3-focused content and services

## Interactive Transition

When the user clicks either the "AI" or "Web3" button, the entire website content and design will dynamically transition to the selected focus area.

This includes:

- Swapping out the hero section
- Updating the main navigation
- Loading the relevant product/service pages
- Changing the overall branding, colors, imagery
- Presenting the content, offers, and CTAs specific to that vertical

The goal is to create a seamless, immersive experience where the user feels they have entered a completely different website focused on their area of interest - AI or Web3.

## Development Plan

1. Implement the split-screen homepage layout with the two prominent buttons.
2. Build the logic to handle the interactive transition when a button is clicked.
3. Design the AI-focused and Web3-focused website variations, including:
   - Hero sections
   - Navigation menus
   - Product/service pages
   - Branding and visuals
4. Ensure a polished, cohesive experience when transitioning between the two views.
5. Test extensively for smooth functionality and transitions.

Please let me know if you have any other specific requirements for this homepage redesign. I'm ready to get started on the development.
